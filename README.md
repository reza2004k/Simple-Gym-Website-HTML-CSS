# 💪 Simple Gym/Fitness Center Website (HTML & CSS)

This project is a static website designed for a gym or fitness center. It focuses on creating a clean, professional, and responsive front-end layout using standard web technologies.

## ✨ Features

* **Clean Layout:** Structured design suitable for presenting information about a fitness club.
* **Information Sections:** Includes areas for services, membership options, or contact details.
* **Pure HTML/CSS:** Implemented without any external libraries or frameworks.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** (Structure)
* **CSS3** (Styling and Layout)

## 🚀 Getting Started

To view this website on your local machine, please follow the steps below carefully.

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
* A tool to extract compressed files (like 7-Zip, WinRAR, or the built-in operating system tool).

### Installation and Viewing

1.  **Download the Code:**
    Download the project repository as a ZIP file or clone it using Git.
2.  **Extract the Files:**
    * **IMPORTANT:** Before running, you must **extract (unzip)** the downloaded file. Locate the downloaded ZIP file, right-click it, and select "Extract All" or a similar option.
    * The project files (`index.html`, `style.css`, and any asset folders like `images`) must be in a standard, uncompressed folder for the website to function correctly.
3.  **Run the Website:**
    * Navigate into the newly extracted folder.
    * Simply **double-click** the main HTML file (it is usually named `index.html` or `gym.html`).
    * The website will open automatically in your default web browser.

Would you like me to write a short, sample `index.html` file to go along with this README, or perhaps suggest a good CSS technique for the gym website?
